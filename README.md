This is a hopefully growing collection of TeX'y stuff made by me

Use them if you like. I take no responsibility for whatever headaches they may cause you.

* Hest:
  This is a beamer theme

* Erebus:
  This is an even nicer beamer theme
  
* Wavylines
  An even even nicer theme! Try it with the [arctic] option

* aautitelblad: 
  A package to generate a title page for AAU project reports
