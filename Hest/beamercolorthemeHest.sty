% The Hest Beamer Theme
%
% This theme is a heavily modified version of the Feather beamer theme
% It uses bits of code from various sources, hacked together by me.
% The code is a mess. Use at your own risk.
%
% The TikZ code for the front page reflection is shamelessly stolen from Till Tantaus PGF-manual, 
% since I made this theme for a presentation about TikZ.
%
% The Aalborg University Logo is probably copyrighted AAU (if you care about such matters),
% so if you intend to use this theme (and you're not a student at AAU), you probably ought to replace it with something else
